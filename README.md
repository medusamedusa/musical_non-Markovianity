# musical_non-Markovianity


This folder contains the C code to compute distribution matrices starting from musical MIDI-like parameters. These matrices can then be used to compute the coefficient of non-Markovianity, as described in the article "Characterization of the degree of Musical non-Markovianity," by M. Mannone and G. Compagno.

@Copyright of the code: Maria Mannone. This was part of her MSc thesis in theoretical physics (chapter 8).
