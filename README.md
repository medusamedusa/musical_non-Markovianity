# musical_non-Markovianity

This fork contains the original C code by [Maria Mannone](http://mariamannone.com/) to compute distribution matrices starting from musical MIDI-like parameters. These matrices can then be used to compute the coefficient of non-Markovianity, as described in the article "Characterization of the degree of Musical non-Markovianity," by M. Mannone and G. Compagno. This code was part of Mannone's MSc thesis in theoretical physics (chapter 8).

Starting in 2023, [Omar Costa Hamido](https://omarcostahamido.com) is reviewing and porting the code to [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com). The goal is to make the code more interactive and optimize the workflow.
